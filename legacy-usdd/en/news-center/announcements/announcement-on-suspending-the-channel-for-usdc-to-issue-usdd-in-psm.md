# Announcement on Suspending the Channel for USDC to Issue USDD in PSM

Dear users:

Due to the volatility of USDC, PSM has temporarily suspended the channel for USDC to issue USDD in PSM. The time of reopening will be further announced. During the suspension, you can still issue USDD using other stablecoins (TUSD, USDT, USDJ) while easily swaping other stablecoins (TUSD, USDT, USDD, USDJ) through PSM.

Meanwhile, TDR will continue working to improve and optimize the PSM functions for better user experience.&#x20;

Welcome to experience.



Thank you for supporting PSM!&#x20;
