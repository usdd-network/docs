# What is USDDOLD?

USDDOLD is an over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin that is issued by TRON DAO Reserve, who is also the custodian. USDDOLD is minted by the whitelisted institutions of the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR) through burning TRX. Its value is backed by the over-collateralization of highly liquid crypto assets under the TDR, including BTC, USDT, USDC, and TRX. The circulation and use of USDDOLD are free from the intervention of any centralized parties. Similar to BTC and ETH, USDDOLD grants its holders full ownership, meaning that no organization or individual has access to freeze usersâ€™ USDDOLD.
