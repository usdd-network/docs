# Getting Started

If you believe in the long-term value of the collateral you've deposited and don't want to sell it, but still need liquidity for other purposes in life, USDD offers a secure and decentralized solution. By minting USDD using your collateral, you can maintain your investment while accessing the funds you need.

## Feature Overview

### Vault Management

The Vault system allows you to manage your collateral and mint USDD securely and efficiently.

* Open a Vault: Select your preferred collateral type, specify the amount of collateral you wish to deposit, and enter the amount of USDD you want to mint. Confirm the transaction with a wallet signature.
* Payback: Repay the minted USDD along with the accrued stability fees to clear your debt and free up your collateral.
* Withdraw: After repaying your debt or ensuring your Vault has sufficient collateral, you can withdraw the collateral you previously deposited.

### Peg Stability Module (PSM)

The USDD PSM enables seamless, zero-fee conversions between USDD and other stablecoins like USDT. This feature plays a critical role in maintaining USDD's 1:1 peg to the US dollar, ensuring stability in all market conditions.

* Convert USDD to USDT or vice versa instantly without slippage.
* A user-friendly way to maintain liquidity and hedge against market volatility.

### Migrate

Easily upgrade from the USDD(OLD) system to the latest version with enhanced features and stability. Migration ensures you can access all the benefits of the new USDD protocol while preserving your assets.

### Portfolio Management

The portfolio dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your Vault activity and collateral health:

* View all active Vaults associated with your wallet.
* Check detailed transaction histories, including minting, payback, and withdrawals.
* Monitor your collateral ratio to avoid liquidation risks.

### Liquidation

Protect the system from under-collateralized positions. If a Vault's collateral ratio falls below the liquidation threshold, the collateral will be liquidated to recover the debt and maintain system stability.

* How It Works: Liquidated Vaults sell collateral to repay debt and fees.
* Stay informed about liquidation risks by checking your Vault regularly.
* Always maintain a healthy collateral ratio to avoid liquidation.

### Auction

The auction system helps redistribute liquidated collateral fairly and efficiently:

* Bid on liquidated collateral to acquire assets at competitive prices.
* View auction details such as Auction ID, debt amount, available collateral, and current bid price.
* Participate in auctions to support system stability while potentially earning a profit.
