# Liquidation

When a Vault's Collateralization Ratio falls below the Min. Collateral Ratio, it becomes eligible for liquidation. This process plays a critical role in maintaining the stability and efficiency of the USDD ecosystem. By participating in liquidations, users can earn rewards while contributing to the system's health.

   1. Liquidation Incentive (Relative): This reward component is proportional to the debt of the liquidated Vault.
   2. Liquidation Incentive (Constant): A fixed reward for successfully liquidating a Vault.
   3.  Transaction Fee: The estimated gas fee for completing the transaction. The actual fee can be verified later using a blockchain explorer.
