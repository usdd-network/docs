# What is the new version of USDD?

The new version of USDD is a fully decentralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, backed by crypto collateral. Unlike traditional stablecoins, it operates without a central authority, ensuring that its value remains stable while being governed by the community. USDD provides users with a secure and transparent digital asset, designed to maintain its 1:1 peg to the US dollar through a system of over-collateralization.

USDD is tamper-proof and cannot be frozen, giving users full control over their assets. With its decentralized nature, USDD avoids the risks of centralization and provides a trustless solution for transactions within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the growing world of DeFi, offering a stable and reliable currency for users to transact and invest.
