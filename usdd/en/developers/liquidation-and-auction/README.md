# Liquidation & Auction

Liquidation is a critical process in the USDD system that ensures the stability and solvency of the protocol. When a user's collateralized debt position (CDP) becomes undercollateralized (i.e., the value of collateral falls below the required threshold), the liquidation mechanism is triggered to maintain the integrity of the system.
