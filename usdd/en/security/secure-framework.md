# Secure Framework

The USDD protocol is designed with a robust security framework to ensure the safety and integrity of user assets and the overall ecosystem. Comprehensive risk assessment processes are employed to identify, mitigate, and monitor potential vulnerabilities.

* **Over-Collateralization**
  * Ensures all minted USDD is backed by digital assets exceeding the value of the stablecoin.
  * Reduces the risk of insolvency during volatile market conditions.
* **Real-Time Monitoring**
  * Continuous tracking of collateral ratios and system health.
  * Alerts are triggered for under-collateralized positions or unusual activities.
* **Smart Contract Audits**
  * All smart contracts are thoroughly audited by independent third-party firms.
  * Ongoing testing ensures contracts are resistant to exploits and vulnerabilities.
* **Liquidation Mechanisms**
  * Automatic liquidation of under-collateralized vaults to protect the protocol from bad debt.
  * Efficient auction systems to maximize recovery value.
* **Peg Stability Module (PSM)**
  * Enables stable and zero-slippage swaps to maintain the USDD peg, even during market fluctuations.
  * Reduces systemic risks by balancing supply and demand effectively.
* **Decentralized Governance**
  * Critical protocol changes are subject to community review and approval.
  * Governance minimizes the risk of unilateral decisions that could compromise security.

By maintaining a proactive approach to risk assessment, the USDD protocol ensures its resilience and reliability in a dynamic blockchain environment.
