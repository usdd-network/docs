# Smart Allocator

The USDD protocol is constantly evolving, and now we are taking a big step towards sustainable yield. We’re proud to introduce [**Smart Allocator**](https://usdd.io/data/3/SA001-A), USDD’s new fully on-chain, transparent, and risk-controlled investment strategy that brings self-sustaining yield to the USDD ecosystem.

Built to be sustainable, transparent and rewarding for users, Smart Allocator allows the protocol to generate yield independently, and its final aim is to remove reliance on external subsidies and pave the way toward long-term economic viability.

## Why Smart Allocator? <a href="#id-4f05" id="id-4f05"></a>

Until now, USDD’s yield has been funded by TRON DAO. While effective for growth, this approach must mature if we want to consider USDD’s long-term development. Incentives backed by centralized subsidies are not sustainable forever, and protocols that depend on them remain vulnerable.

Smart Allocator changes this by enabling the USDD protocol itself to invest idle capital, earn yield, and redistribute those earnings to the community. All this is achieved without affecting peg stability, allowing users a low-risk way to earn yield without compromising stability and security.

With Smart Allocator, USDD is more than just a stablecoin. It becomes a **self-sustaining financial system** that works in the long term.

## How Smart Allocator Works <a href="#f419" id="f419"></a>

To fully understand how Smart Allocator enables sustainable, protocol-driven yield, let’s walk through each step of the process:

**1. Capital is invested**

Smart Allocator is a yield-sharing initiative where capital from USDD’s cash reserve is deployed into investment opportunities to earn returns in the form of interest and platform rewards.

* The overall investment strategy is conservative and under the USDD team’s dynamic monitoring.
* The chosen investment platforms such as Aave are selected by USDD and JUST DAO teams based on strict risk controls, prioritizing high liquidity and high reliability.
* The investment cap is set at a certain amount.

**2. Investment is regularly reviewed.**

* Investments will be made in steps.
* After the first investment is made, it will be carefully reviewed based on market conditions, liquidity amount, and amount of returns.
* This review will determine the next investment amount and chosen platform(s).
* This review process continues with each investment.

**3. Returns are redistributed to users**

As the investments earn yield, the protocol redistributes net returns back to users, excluding a small portion kept as a risk reserve.

* Returns are regularly redistributed as staking rewards, allocated based on users’ contribution to the ecosystem.
* The entire returns redistribution process is automated, on-chain, auditable, and fully transparent.

Users can track each step of the [Smart Allocator](https://usdd.io/data/3/SA001-A) process and view various real-time metrics such as debt, invested amount, APY, etc.

USDD smart contracts have also passed [Chainsecurity’s audit](https://www.chainsecurity.com/security-audit/usdd-rwa-smart-contracts), which found zero vulnerabilities outside of acceptable risks.

## Benefits of Smart Allocator <a href="#b991" id="b991"></a>

Smart Allocator brings a range of benefits to both the USDD protocol and USDD users, enhancing user experience and system performance at the same time. Key benefits of Smart Allocator include:

* **Creating sustainable yield** — Reducing dependence on external subsidies and allowing for long-term growth
* **Rewarding users with investment returns** — Continuing to reward users by distributing regular yield from protocol-generated profits
* **Improving USDD’s overall yield** — Turning idle capital into income-generating assets
* **Optimizing capital efficiency** — Deploying surplus funds effectively without affecting user liquidity or redemption
* **Diversifying systemic risks** — Spreading investments across multiple platforms and increasing the protocol’s resilience to market volatility and other vulnerabilities
