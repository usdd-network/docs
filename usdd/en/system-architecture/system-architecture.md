# System Architecture

The USDD system architecture is designed to ensure stability, security, transparency, and scalability. It operates as a decentralized platform leveraging robust collateral mechanisms, efficient liquidation processes, and community-driven governance to maintain the stability of USDD and its integration within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Collateral Management

USDD employs an over-collateralization model to safeguard its stability and reduce systemic risk. Users can lock eligible assets, such as TRX, and USDT, to mint USDD. Key aspects of collateral management include:

* Over-Collateralization: Users are required to maintain a collateral ratio above the minimum threshold, varying by asset based on its volatility.
* Multi-Collateral Support: Diversification of supported collateral types minimizes risk and promotes flexibility for users.
* Real-Time Monitoring: The system continuously monitors collateral ratios, alerting users to potential risks and ensuring prompt responses.

## Liquidation Mechanism

The protocol incorporates a secure liquidation process to address under-collateralized positions and protect the system’s integrity:

* Triggering Liquidation: When a vault’s collateral ratio falls below the minimum threshold, it becomes eligible for liquidation.
* Keeper Incentives: Liquidators, or “keepers,” are incentivized with rewards to participate in the liquidation process.
* Risk Containment: This mechanism ensures that under-collateralized positions do not threaten the overall stability of the system.

## Auction System

The USDD platform utilizes an efficient auction system to optimize the management of liquidated collateral and system deficits:

* Collateral Auctions: Liquidated collateral is auctioned to recover outstanding debt. Participants bid competitively, ensuring fair market pricing and efficient debt recovery. Collateral Auctions are conducted using a Dutch model, where prices decrease over time, encouraging timely participation and equitable pricing.
* Debt Auctions: In the event of a protocol deficit, the system initiates debt auctions, selling governance tokens to recapitalize and maintain stability.

## Peg Stability Module (PSM)

The PSM (Peg Stability Module) is designed to maintain the peg of stablecoins through a fixed 1:1 exchange rate (e.g., between USDD and USDT). Users can exchange one stablecoin (such as USDT) for USDD directly, with no slippage. This process involves:

* Minting: When users exchange USDT for USDD, the system mints new USDD and sends it to the user while depositing the USDT into the reserve pool.
* Redeeming: When users exchange USDD for USDT, the system burns the USDD and releases the corresponding USDT from the reserve pool.

The Peg Stability Module (PSM) plays a critical role in maintaining USDD’s 1:1 peg to the US dollar by facilitating and hence reducing arbitrage through seamless stablecoin conversions:

* Zero-Slippage Swaps: Users can exchange USDD for other stablecoins, such as USDT, at a 1:1 ratio without incurring slippage.
* Gas-Only Transactions: The PSM allows for seamless swaps with no service fees, requiring users to pay only the gas fees. This approach fosters user trust and enhances liquidity.
* Demand-Supply Balancing: By offering stablecoin swaps, the PSM mitigates price volatility during periods of heightened market activity.

## Governance and Risk Management

USDD leverages a decentralized governance framework to ensure adaptive decision-making and effective risk mitigation. Further details will be shared soon—stay tuned!

## Transparency and Auditing

Transparency is a cornerstone of the USDD protocol, fostering user trust and ensuring accountability:

* On-Chain Auditing: All transactions, collateral reserves, and system metrics are recorded on the blockchain, enabling real-time verification.
* Performance Dashboards: User-friendly dashboards display vital statistics, including total USDD minted, collateral locked, and liquidation activity.
* Open-Source Integrity: The protocol’s codebase is fully open-source, allowing the community and security experts to audit and enhance its reliability.
* Independent Third Party Auditing: The smart contracts have been thoroughly audited by independent third-party security firms to ensure safety and reliability.
